  <Overview>Private networks made easy&#13;
&#13;
Connect all your devices using WireGuard,® without the hassle.&#13;
Tailscale makes it as easy as installing an app and signing in.&#13;
&#13;
This container sets up tailscale for unraid.&#13;
&#13;
It will register as hostname unraid, if you want to change that see 'Extra Parameters' below and change to the hostname you would like.&#13;
&#13;
** IMPORTANT When you first start this container you must check the log file for the logon URL and then enter it into a browser and logon to tail scale. I would then also advise setting the keys to not expire for your unraid host **&#13;
&#13;
** Note that this will expose your whole server into your tailscale VPN network ** &#13;
Do not do this if you do not understand what that means.</Overview>
